Here are the instructions on how to install Linux on a Chromebook, tested on the
Chromebook I use:   ACER Chromebook 14  CB3-431.

Use Google to search for 'crouton' and go there. This is the 'crouton' program for
installing Linux alongside the standard Chrome OS. This requires installng the
crouton extension, downloading the crouton program, and then installing your
desired Linux variant.

I use lxde, as disk space on Chromebook is limited, and lxde has small footprint.

  sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xiwi,lxde

This will run for a while and them seem to stop. However, if you look
closely, you will find that Crouton is waiting for you to enter a username.
(This is not immediately obvious, as the question is displayed in dark
colors against an even darker background.)

I then suggest installing the following programs:

  meld - visual file comparator
  okular - reader for PDF files
  git - to clone the SETL4 system from github.

If you want to be able to build SETL4, do the following

  cd
  git clone http://github.com/setl4/spitbol4
  sudo apt-get install nasm

Nasm is the netwide assembler for x86_64.

You also need to install musl, as described in the file 'musl'.


Going forwrd, access Linux as follows:

From Chrome OS, type 

        ctrl-alt-t

to open shell

Type

    sudo startlxde

to start lxde

You can now switch between lxde and Chrome OS using

    ctrl-alt-tab-back
or
    ctrl-alt-tab-forward

where 'back' is the back arrown key, the second from left on top row, and
'forward' is the forward rrow key, the third from left on the top row.

Good luck. Away you go ...
