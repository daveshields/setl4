I know of a nuclear weapon that was used to create a more pleasant work environment.
During my college years I worked summers at the Air Force Weapons Lab (AFWL),

There was a young officer, Lt. C, who was a real pest. Noting his absence
one day, I asked what had become of him, and learned he had been sent to Yucca
Flats in Nevada to supervise an underground nuclear test, and that he would
be away for six weeks or so.

I thought this an effective way to remove him from our presence. There was
the chance he might blow himself up -- a not unpleasant thought -- though
the possibilty that he would destroy a chunk of Nevada in the process was worrisome.
