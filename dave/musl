Installing musl

You need musl library and musl-gcc wrapper to build SPITBOL4.

 Here's how to install musl:

Go to http://www.musl-libc.org and Download the mainline version.

Unpack the tar file and go the musl directory.

Do
  ./configure
  make
  sudo install musl

Then edit the ~/.bashrc file and add this line at the end

  export PATH=/usr/local/musl/bin/;$PATH

Test this with

  which musl-gcc

which should return name of file in /usr/local/musl/bin
