# concordance
This repository contains several SPITBOL programs that can be used to generate concordances and to examine
and search the generated concordances. Initial texts include the text of Genesis, the King James version
of the Old Testament, and Shakespeare's Sonnets, obtained from the Gutenberg Project.

We thank the many hard workers at Gutenberg who have collectively produced a freely available massive collection that
includes the greatest literature in the English language.

The SPITBOL programs are licensed under the simplified two-clause BSD license, the text of which can be found in the file LICENSE.

The Project Gutenberg files contain the licensing information within the text.
