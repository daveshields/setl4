# SETL4 - A New Implementation of SETL


SETL4 is an implementation of SETL (SET Language) written in SPITBOL.

It can be viewed as an extension of SPITBOL that adds set-theoretic datatypes,
functions, and operators; and also as an implementation of SETL that includes 
the datatypes, functions, and operators of SPITBOL. 

Either way, SETL4 provides raw power and speed for non-numeric computation.

## Installation and Usage

To install SETL, first visit http://github.com/setl4. Download the zip file or,
if you are familiar with git, clone the repository:

```
    git clone http://github.com/setl4
```

Copy the file `bin/setl4` to a directory on your $PATH.

To use SETL4, first enter

```
setl4
```

You should see a list of the options. Then enter the program `try.stl`:
```
    -include "setl4.stl"
    s = new('set hello world')
    show(s)
    end
```

If that works, then you are on you way to having fun using SETL4 to write
more interesting programs.

Directory `setl4/tests` contains test programs.

Directory `setl4/examples` contains various demonstration program.
This written in SPITBOL have a name ending in 'sbl'. One goal of the
project is to translate these programs to SETL4


## What is SETL?

SETL (SET Language)  is  a programming language with finite sets as 
the fundamental data type. It was created by Jacob T. "Jack" Schwartz 
of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (CIMS) of New York 
University (NYU).

Jack founded the SETL project in 1970. It was later funded by two 
five-year grants from the Office of Naval Research.

SETL was used to write NYU Ada/Ed, the first validated Ada compiler.
Devloped on the DEC Vax 11/780, Ada/Ed was ported to the IBM PC (DOS)
by a team led by Dave Shields.

## Why are sets so important?

One of the great discoveries in mathematics in the twentieth century was the
realization that ALL of mathematics can be expressed using sets. There is no branch of
mathematics that does not use sets in some way.

For a good introduction to set theory, see the book "Naive Set Theory" by Paul Halmos, a
great mathematician as well as one of the best expository writers about mathematics. The book in
PDF format can be found at http://elienasrallah.com/dl/Halmos%20Naive%20%set%theory.pdf

## Why are sets useful in programming?

Programming is a form of applied mathematics, as well as a field of engineering. Good programs
not only find a solution but they do so using as little time and space as possible.


Every program requires a specification of what is desired, whether written down,
or as just a vision in the programmer's mind.

Since creating programs is a branch of mathematics, the ideal specification should be
mathematical, and, since all of mathematics use set theory in some way, the specification
is best be written using set-theoretic data structures and operations.

(Note, as an aside, that if it is not possible to write a specification for a program
based on set theory, then the resulting program only has meaning in an alternate 
universe where mathematics does not apply.)

For example, consider how to write a program that finds all the primes less 
than a given integer _n_.

A number _n_ is prime if its only factors are one and the number itself. This is the same
as saying there is no number greater than one and less than _n_ that divides _n_.

This can be expressed in SETL4 as

```
    exists(new('iter 2 ' n - 1),'multiple(n,this)') :s(freturn)f(return)
```

Here is the code for the function prime in SETL4, which makes use of the observations
that even numbers, except for two, are not prime, and only need to check for multiples
for integers no greater than the square root of _n_

```
    define('prime(n)iter,this')                 :(prime.end)

*   Tests if _n_ is a prime integer.

prime

    n = integer(n) +n
    eq(n,2)                                     :s(return)
    even(n)                                     :s(freturn)

    exists(new('iter 3 ' square.root(n) ' 2'), 'multiple(n,this)') :s(freturn)f(return)

prime.end
```

Here is the code for exists():

```
    define('exists(set,expr)this,e')                :(exists.end)

*   Tests if there is an element in _set_ such that _expr_ is true.

exists

    loop(set)

exists.loop

    this = next(set)                                :f(freturn)
    exists = eval(expr)                             :f(exists.loop)s(return)


exists.end

```

This is why SETL4 can be viewed as an executable specification language. If you
specify a problem using set theory, then you can use SETL4 to execute that
specification to get the result; in other programming languages you need to
translate the specification into a different form, using arrays to represent
a set, using loop statements to loop over sets, and so forth.


## What is SPITBOL?

SNOBOL is a general programming language with special emphasis on processing 
strings and text that was  developed at Bell Labs in the 1960's by a team 
led by Ralph Griswold. Their final version was called SNOBOL4.

Macro SPITBOL, or SPITBOL, is a very efficient implemenation of SNOBOL4.
Created by Robert B. K. Dewar and Ken Belcher in 1969, SPITBOL/360 
was written in IBM/360 assembly language, in what Dewar called
"aggressive assembly."

For example, SNOBOL4 requires maintaining a count of the number of 
statements executed and the ability to stop execution when a specified 
number of statements have been executed.  SPITBOL/360 does this by
computing an unnormalized floating point constant such that successive 
increments result in floating point overflow when the limit is reached.

Dewar and Belcher also wrote Realia COBOL, a COBOL compiler for Intel/x86 
written in COBOL. It produced very efficient code, better
code than, for example, that produced by IBM's product COBOL compiler.

Dewar ported SPITBOL/360 to several machines. Dewar joined the CIMS faculty
as a Professor in the early 1970's. In 1973, while working
with Anthony P. "Tony" McCann of Leeds University, he developed
Minimal, a portable assembly language. Dewar and McCann then rewrote
SPITBOL in Minimal, producing Macro SPITBOL, or SPITBOL. 
The implementation has proved very stable, with few changes in
several decades.

Macro SPITBOL is remarkably small. The code consists of about 28,000
lines: 2000 lines of comments defining Minimal, 5000 lines of constant/data 
declarations, and 21,000 lines of code.  Every line has a comment.
The executable for x86 Linux is 144 kilobytes.

SPITBOL was implemented for many machines and operating systems by
a small team that included Steve Duff, Mark Emmer, Bob Goldberg, and Dave Shields:
ICL 1900, Univac, CDC 6600, IBM PC, Apple Macintosh, SUN Solaris Sparc, 
Microsoft (DOS/NT/Windows), Intel x86_64 (Unix/Linux), and x86_64 Apple iOS.  
Special credit is due Mark Emmer, who led the project from the mid 1980's
to 2009. Dave Shieldsl has maintained SPITBOL since then.


## Why the name SETL4?

The SETL Project produced three implementations of SETL. The first was
written by Dave Shields in BALM, a language developed by Prof. Malcom 
Harrison of CIMS, the second by Henry S. "Hank" Warren in PL/I while on 
leave from IBM, and the third by Robert B. K. Dewar and Art Grand in LITTLE,
a low-level implementation language developed at CIMS.

SETL4 is the fourth implementation of SETL produced by a member 
(Dave Shields) of the NYU SETL project, hence the name SETL4.

## Sets in SETL4

SETL4 provides several kinds of sets.

Sets of kind 'set' are a collection of distinct members.

Sets of kind 'map' consist of a series or ordered pairs,
called entries. The first element of an enter is the key,
the second is the value.  No two entries in the map can 
have the same key but different values.

Sets of kind 'iterator' consist of positive integers of the form

```
    low, low + step, ... high
```

For example `'iterator 5 25 5'` is the set {5 10 15 20 25}.
Iterators support efficient iteration, and suppor only the
operations of iteration and membership.

Sets of kind 'integer' define a map on the positive integers.
The members usually, but not necessarily consist of a sequence
of integers with no gaps; for example 'sequence 5' is a map defined
on 1, 2, ... 5.

Sets of kind 'sequence' ('seq') are a map defined on a set of positive integers
that usually, but not necessarily, consists of a consecutive sequence of integers.

Sets of kind 'string' consists of a map from integers to characters.

By convention, the kinds are writtten 'int', 'iter', 'map', and 'set'.

## Additonal SETL4 Data Types

SETL4 provides the following data types in addtion to _set_: 

_entry_   _line_   _token_

where 

-   `entry(key,value)`            is an entry in a map;
-   `line(mark,text)`             is a line of text and an associated mark (tag); and
-   `token(lineno,ndx,type,text)` is a lexeme, or lexical token.


### SETL4 Global variables


```
setl4.ascii.name = 
setl4.ascii.value =  
setl4.random_var =
```

### Useful Patterns

```
setl4.any.digit         =   any('0123456789')
setl4.span.digits       =   span('0123456789')
setl4.break.digit       =   break('0123456789')

setl4.break.letter      =   break(&lcase &ucase)
setl4.any.letter        =   any(&lcase &ucase)
setl4.span.letters      =   span(&lcase &ucase)
setl4.span.spaces       =   span(' ' char(9))
setl4.break.space       =   break(' ' char(9))

setl4.any.word          =   any(&lcase &ucase '0123456789')
setl4.span.word         =   span(&lcase &ucase '0123456789')

```


## Set Data Type
-------------

A set is defined by the following datatype:

  `data('set(set.index,set.key,set.kind,set.size,set.next,set.low,set.high,set.max,set.step,set.text,set.seq,set.this)')`

where

-   _set.index_         a SPITBOL table used to map the integer
id assigned each element to the value of the element.
It is used to support fast iteration.

-   _set.key_           a SPITBOL table mapping set elements to index entries.

-   _set.kind_          is the kind of the set, one of 'set', 'map', 'int, 'seq'.
The kind is  specified when the set is created. The default value is 'set'.

-   _set.size_          the current number of members.

-   _set.next_           is iteration index when iterating over set
when iterating over a 

-   _set.low_           lower bound of _int_ 

-   _set.high_          upper bound of _int_ 

-   _set.step_         number of values between members of set of kind _int_.

-   _set.text_          is the text of the set of kind _str_

-   _set.this_          the last value returned by the _next_ primitive

-   _set.max_           maximum number of elements. This applies to sets of kind 'integers'.

## Sets of integers

SETL4 sets of kind 'integers' provide an efficient implementation of a set of 
integers, in the form of a string such that an integer _i_ is in the set only
if the i-th character of the string is '+'. The string is represented by a 
table in blocks of 100 characters, so that the first block represents the integers 
1 .. 100, and so forth. New chunks are allocated only when necesary.  The SPITBOL 
function BREAK is used to find the next element in the set when iterating over the set.

## Maps

In mathematics, a map defined on a finite set is a set of 
ordered pairs, or entries,  that define a relation between the 
first element of an entry, its _key_, and the second element 
of the entry, the value of the map for _key_.

    `data('entry(key,value)')`

The SPITBOL datatype TABLE provides the machinery to implement maps.
SPITBOL provides no way to determine the number of entries in a table
other than converting the map to an array. This is the only way in 
SPITBOL to iterate over a SPITBOL table.

For this reason, maps are implemented using two tables: _index_ and _key_.
Each new entry added to a map is given an integer id, starting with one.  
The field _index_ maps the id's to the associated pairs.
The entries in _index_ allow efficient iteration over the  

The table _key_ maps keys in the map to the corresponding entry in the map.
The entries in _key_ permit efficient retrieval of the map's value for a given key.

SETL4 also provides the datatype _stack_ that implements a stack, providing
the functions _push_ and _pop_. Stacks are created by the function _new.stack_.

    `data('stack(stack.stack,stack.top)')`


Additional operations provided as an artifact of the implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of the tables _set.index_ and _set.key_ to implement a set makes it
possible to provide some operations not available in in standard set theory. 
For example, it is possible to retrieve elements using the function _get_. 
_Get(s,i)_ retrieves the i-th element in the set.

The function _rank_ can be used to determine the order in which the elements 
of a set are accessed during an iteration, or to 'sort' the tables implementing
the set. For example, _rank(s,'+v') sorts a map in increasing order of the
values of the map. _rank(s,'-v') sorts the values in descendng order, and
so forth. For example, here is the code to find the ten members with 
the largest values in a map:

```
        rank(map,'-v')
        largest = new('set')
        iter = new('iter 1 10')
        loop(iter)
    
    largest.add
    
        add(largest,next(iter))               :s(largest.add)
```

 _Rank_ is used by the _show_ function to display the values of a set or
map in a standard order. For example, if _s_ is a set with the elements
'a', 'b' and 'c', however the order in which they were added, then _show(s)_
produces `{ set 'a' 'b' 'c' }`, not `{set 'b' 'c' 'a' }`.
