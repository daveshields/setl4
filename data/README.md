Programs, like any living organism, need food to prosper.

The programmer's staff of life comes as  data, in the form of a file or
an argument to the program.

SETL4 is an extension of SPITBOL; SPITBOL is an extension of SNOBOL4,
which is a later version of SNOBOL;  and SNOBOL was designed from the start 
to be a language for manipulating strings.

We believe that the most interesting -- and most fun -- strings to
manipulate and study in learning the Art of Programming are to be
found in the world's greatest literature; and so here include sample
works so that -- if nothing else --  students will be exposed 
to great literature in the course of their studies of programming.

Progamming is just a very disciplined form of writing, and examination of examples chosen
from the highest form of writing -- literature --  will, hopefully, encourage 
students to develop their own writing skills, both in code itself, as well
as the most important part of any program: its documentation.

The two greatest works of literature in the English language are
The King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.  The initial
files in this directory thus include the following texts obtained from Project Gutenberg:


http://gutenberg.org

-   genesis.txt                     - first book of the King James Old Testament
-   hamlet.txt                      - Shakespeare's Hamlet
-   kbj-new.txt                     - King James Bible New Testament
-   kbj-old.txt                     - King James Bible Old Testament
-   romeo-and-juliet.txt            - Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare
-   shakespeare-complete-works.txt  - Complete Works of William Shakespeare
-   shakespeare-sonnets.txt         - Sonnets of William Shakespeard

We wish to acknowledge the work of the many volunteer members of the Gutenberg
Project who have compiled these texts, and the project for making them freely available.

A dictionary is to a language what sets are to mathematics: the foundation
on which all else rests.

The file

   dictionary.txt


is based on the "ENABLE Word List", as described in:

-   http://www.zyngawithfriends.com/wordswithfriends/support/WWF_Rulebook.html
-   http://code.google.com/archive/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads
-   http://wordplays.com/official-scrabble-word-lists/enable-word-list

The dictionary also includes some words accepted by the program Words With
Friends (WWF). There is no official list of these added words. They were
obtained -- the hard way -- in the course of being bested at many games of WWF
by Phil Glazer, and encountering their use. For those not familiar with
WWF, knowing "Qi" is accepted can increase your score, as well as "Za" and
so forth.
